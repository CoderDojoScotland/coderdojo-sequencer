### Live Coding


Add more of an element of [live-coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding) by changing samples,synths and effects while the sequencer is playing.

You may already have changed the sounds and samples in `NOTES` and `SEQUENCES`, but you can also change the synth being used and the effects by changing the code in the Trigger function, e.g.:


![synth and effects 1](http://glasgow.coderdojo.co/DigitalDJ/synth1.png)

or 

![synth and effects 2](http://glasgow.coderdojo.co/DigitalDJ/synth2.png)

Just edit the code and press Run again to update the sounds without stopping the music.


### Clear Sounds


Write a clear function - either to clear all the sounds, just the last one added, or the sound related to a particular pad.


### Add Lights

Write some socket code to control an off-the shelf DMX light.
