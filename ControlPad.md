##Control Pad
We're going to start by making the Control Pad for our sequencer - mainly because it's going to take a while for the paint to dry.
### Paint the Control Pad

Draw out a series of shapes - 6 should control notes (like a keyboard) and 6 should control samples (like drum pads). You don't have to stick to traditional keyboard and drum shapes though - the pads can be any shape you like:

Draw a line from each pad to the same edge of the paper.  The lines shouldn't cross and each one should end in a small blob where you'll connect the clips.  

Once you're happy with your shapes paint them in with the Bare Conductive paint.  This can be a bit tricky at first as it's quite thick and sticky.  Try not to put too much on the brush as it will take longer to dry.

You can connect the pads to the edge of the page with painted lines of Bare Conductive, or use the squeezy tube of paint that comes with the kits, which is easier to do more delicate work with.

Leave the control pads to dry while you do the next part: [setting up the sequencer](./Sequencer.md).
